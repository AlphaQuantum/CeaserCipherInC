### What Is In Here
-C Program that Encrypts a message from a text file
-C Program that executes brute force on the encrypted message in another text file
### Addional Notes
The program is very easy, but it might help new people to C, so why not posting it :D
Why did i include the exe? because yes...jokes aside, maybe people are lazy to compile it so, why not
